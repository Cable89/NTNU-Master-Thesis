\section{Topics for further research}

There is a broad agreement in the hobby community that the streamer affects the system, but its effects on the system are not clear from the work done here. Parameters for the streamer model mentioned should be found to further investigate how the streamer influences the voltages and currents on the output.

The component values and parameters and its effect on the output signal are only substantiated with theoretical work and should be verified experimentally.

By varying the supply voltage for the power amplifier one could acheive AM modulation instead of PDM modulation.

When pulses on the input $X2$ get too close, the coil rig has not had time to swing down, if a new pulse is input before it has swung down one may risk switching while the current is not zero, and the response may be different. It would be interesting to investigate wether the latch in the interrupter will or can be used to keep the signal $X5$ in sync.
