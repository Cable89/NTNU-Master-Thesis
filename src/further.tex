\section{Topics for further research}


There is a broad agreement in the hobby community that the streamer affects the system, but its effects on the system are not clear from the work done here. Parameters for the streamer model mentioned should be found to further investigate how the streamer influences the voltages and currents on the output.

The component values and parameters and its effect on the output signal are only substantiated with theoretical work and should be verified experimentally.
