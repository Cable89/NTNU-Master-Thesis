\textbf{Driver:} Electronics for supplying signal and power to a coil rig forming a tesla coil.

\textbf{Coil rig:} Coil inductors and capacitors forming a resonant circuit in the arrangement of a resonant transformer.

\textbf{Primary resonant circuit:} The Coil inductor and capacitor on the primary side of the resonant transformer in a coil rig.

\textbf{Secondary resonant circuit:} The Coil inductor and capacitor on the secondary side of the resonant transformer in a coil rig.
