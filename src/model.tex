\section{Transfer function for coil rig}
\label{sec:coilrigmath}

The schematic shown in \cref{fig:spolerigg11} is the schematic for the coil rig.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Skjema/Spolerigg1_r.pdf}
    \caption{Coil rig}
    \label{fig:spolerigg11}
\end{figure}

$R_1$ is the resistance in the primary circuit (mainly the cable from the driver to the coil rig), $R_2$ is the resistance in the secondary circuit (mainly the resistance in $L_2$). $C_1$ is the primary capacitor, $L_1$ is the primary coil, $L_2$ is the secondary coil, and $C_2$ is the secondary capacitance (or top load). $G_1$ is the electrical arc modelled as a conductance, see \cref{eq:g1} for the model of $G_1$, this model is a combination of Cassie \citep{cassie} and Mayr \citep{mayr} models for electrical arcs presented in \citep{575670}. $U_{X6}$ is the voltage output from the driver to the primary resonant circuit, $U_{X7}$ is the voltage output from the secondary resonant circuit (the voltage driving the electrical arc).

This schematic can be simplified by introducing the mutual inductance $M$ as a component as shown in \cref{fig:spolerigg2}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Skjema/Spolerigg2_r.pdf}
    \caption{Coil rig simplified}
    \label{fig:spolerigg2}
\end{figure}

And then further simplified by representing the branches of the circuit as impedances as shown in \cref{fig:spolerigg3}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Skjema/Spolerigg3_r.pdf}
    \caption{Coil rig represented with impedances}
    \label{fig:spolerigg3}
\end{figure}

Using the mesh current method we get \cref{eq:1} and \cref{eq:2}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
    U_{X6} - I_1 Z_1 - (I_1 - I_2) Z_2 = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
    (I_2 - I_1) Z_2 - I_2 Z_3 - I_2 Z_4 = 0
\end{equation}

We then solve these two equations for $I_1$. Set \cref{eq:1_2} equal to \cref{eq:2_2}, solve for $\frac{U_{X7}}{U_{X6}}$ and substitute in \cref{eq:3}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:3}
    U_{X7} = I_2 Z_4
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1_2}
    I_1 = \frac{U_{X6} + I_2 Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}
\end{equation}'

\begin{equation} \label{eq:2_2}
    I_1 = \frac{(Z_2 - Z_3 - Z_4) I_2}{Z_2}
\end{equation}

We then have the transfer function $H(s)$ for the coil rig \cref{eq:4}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:4}
    \frac{U_{X7}}{U_{X6}} = H(s) = \frac{Z_2 \cdot Z_4}{Z_1 \cdot (Z_2 - Z_3 - Z_4) - Z_2 \cdot (Z_3 + Z_4))}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation} \label{eq:4_1}
    Z_1 = R_1 + \frac{1}{s C_1} + s L_1 - s M,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:4_2}
    Z_2 = s M,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:4_3}
    Z_3 = s L_2 - s M + R_2,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:4_4}
    Z_4 = \frac{1}{s C_2} + \frac{1}{G_1},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:4_5}
    M = k \sqrt{L_1 L_2}.
\end{equation}

%\begin{equation}
%    H(s) = \frac{s M (\frac{1}{s C_2} + \frac{1}{G_1})}{(R_1 + \frac{1}{s C_1} + s L_1 - s M) \cdot (s M - (s L_2 - s M + R_2) - (\frac{1}{s C_2} + \frac{1}{G_1})) - s M \cdot ((s L_2 - s M + R_2) + (\frac{1}{s C_2} + \frac{1}{G_1})))}
%\end{equation}

% (Z2*Z4)/(Z1*(Z2-Z3-Z4)-Z2*(Z3+Z4)), Z1=(R1+1/(s*C1)+s*L1-s*M), Z2=(s*M, Z3=(s*L2)-(s*M)+R2), Z4=(1/(s*C2))+(1/G1))
However to be able to analyze this transfer function we have to order it into standard form. Meaning isolating $s$,$s^2$,$s^3$ etc. and expanding the factors. This leads to \cref{eq:5}.

%\begin{equation}
%    H(s) = \frac{s^2 M C_1}{s^4(2 M L_1 C_2 C_1 - L_1 L_2 C_2 C_1) + s^3(2 M R_1 C_2 C_1 - L_2 R_1 C_2 C_1 + 2 M L_1 G_1 C_1 - L_1 R_2 C_2 C_1) + s^2(2 M R_1 G_1 C_1 - R_1 R_2 C_2 C_1 + 2 M C_2 - C_2 L_2 - L_1 R_2 G_1 C_1 - L_1 C_1 + 2 M C_1) + s(2 M G_1 - R_1 R_2 G_1 C_1 - R_1 C_1 - L_2 G_1) - R_2 G_1- 1}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5}
    H(s) = \frac{s^3 f + s^2 g}{s^4 a + s^3 b + s^2 c + s d + e}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5_1}
    a = (C_1 C_2 G_1 L_1 L_2)-2 (C_1 C_2 G_1 L_1 M)+(C_1 C_2 G_1 M^2),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5_2}
    b = (C_1 C_2 G_1 L_1 R_2)+(C_1 C_2 G_1 L_2 R_1)-2 (C_1 C_2 G_1 M R_1)+(C_1 C_2 L_1),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5_3}
    c = (C_1 C_2 G_1 R_1 R_2)+(C_1 C_2 R_1)+(C_1 G_1 L_1)+(C_2 G_1 L_2)-2 (C_2 G_1 M),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5_4}
    d = (C_1 G_1 R_1)+(C_2 G_1 R_2)+C_2,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5_5}
    e = G_1,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5_6}
    f = C_1 C_2 M,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} \label{eq:5_7}
    g = C_1 G_1 M.
\end{equation}

Orders of magnitude for the parameters in the transfer function is shown in \cref{tab:mod_params} these sizes are rounded approximate sizes for a DRSSTC, and are found from the implementation of Omega Verksted \citep{prosjektoppgave}.

Shown in \cref{fig:bode} is the bode plot of the transfer function $H(s)$ \cref{eq:5} of the resonant circuit with the orders of magnitude in \cref{tab:mod_params}. Where the value for $G_1$ is the minimum conductance possible when there is no electrical discharge. With electrical discharge (streamer or corona) the conductance will increase. The figures in this section is generated with Matlab and the code used to generate them can be found in \cref{sec:appdx:matlab}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/CoilRigBode.eps}
    \caption{Bode plot of $H(s)$}
    \label{fig:bode}
\end{figure}

We would expect a resonance frequency given by \cref{eq:f0} and \cref{tab:mod_params} of $f_0 = 160$kHz. Here we see that the resonance frequency in \cref{fig:bode} is $f_0 = 157$kHz, this is close to the expected. The magnitude at resonance is 47dB. We also see a steeper slope at frequencies lower than $f_0$ than above $f_0$.

%The resonant frequency $f_0$ we would expect is given by \cref{eq:f0}, by inserting the values from \cref{tab:mod_params} we get $f_0 = 160$kHz


%Here we see that the frequency response takes the form of a resonant circuit with a resonant frequency $f_0$ of 157kHz, which is close to the frequency one would expect with the orders of magnitude given in \cref{tab:mod_params} and the equation for resonance frequency \cref{eq:f0} of 160kHz. The magnitude at resonance is 36,7dB and then flattens at a magnitude 26dB at frequencies higher than resonance.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:f0}
    f_0 = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L_1 C_1}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Q}
    Q = \frac{f_0}{BW} = \frac{X}{R} = \frac{2 \pi f L_1}{R_1}
\end{equation}
Where $BW$ is the bandwidth.

In \cref{fig:step}, we see the step and impulse responses of the transfer function $H(s)$ for the resonant circuit.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/CoilRigResponse.eps}
    \caption{Step and impulse response for $H(s)$}
    \label{fig:step}
\end{figure}

Here we see that we have a damped sinusiodal response with a frequency $f_s$ of 156kHz witch is the same frequency as the resonance frequency $f_0$ of the frequency response. This response attenuates within a few cycles.

\Cref{fig:polezero} shows the poles and zeros of the transfer function $H(s)$ of the resonant circuit.

\todo{Bytte $\omega$ med $f$ ?}

Here we observe a complex conjugated pole pair in the left half plane close to the imaginary axis, a single pole on the real axis far in the left half plane, a pole and a zero on the real axis close to origo, as well as two zeros in origo. From this we can say that the system is dominated by the complex pole pair and the zeros in origo. The pole and zero at the same place will cancel eachother out, and since the last pole is far to the left in relation to the complex pole pair, over four times as far out on the real axis at -46, than the complex pole pair is on the complex axis at $\pm 9,9$. It will have an effect but not dominating. A complex pole pair together with two zeros in origo implies a band pass filter, this matches well with the frequency response. The closer to the imaginary axis the pole pair is the higher the magnitude in the frequency response. This is consistent with the desired functionality. The pole far out on the real axis will give positive (higher magnitude) contribution that is at maximum in origo and reduces when the frequency increases.

\Cref{fig:crlinsim} shows the result of a linear simulation of the transfer function of the resonant circuit with a square wave input signal with amplitude 160V peak and frequency 159kHz.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \caption{Linear simulation of transfer function $H(s)$ with square wave X6 with $f=f_0$ as input, and X7 is output}
    \label{fig:crlinsim}
\end{figure}

We see here that the output signal X7 starts with a quarter period of the step response shown in \cref{fig:step}, and then when the voltage peaks, meaning when the differential of the voltage is zero, a new step response with opposite phase is added to the output signal. This makes the output signal grow rapidly for ten cycles before flattening out at 427kV.

\Cref{fig:crlinsim10T} shows the same simulation as \cref{fig:crlinsim}, but here the input signal is set to zero after 10 periods.

    \label{fig:crlinsim10T}
\end{figure}

Here we see that the voltage continues to resonate after the input is set to zero, but attenuates exponentially.

\section{Transfer function for primary current I1}
\label{sec:mod_fb}
If we use \cref{eq:1} and \cref{eq:2} and solve for $\frac{I_1}{U_{X6}}$ we get the transfer function for the current flowing in the primary resonant circuit $I_1$ this is the signal that is coupled to the feedback signals X8 and X9 with current sense transformers $L_3$ and $L_4$. This is transfer function $H_{FB}$ is shown in \cref{eq:fb_1}. Where $Z_1$ to $Z_4$ are the same impedances as given in \cref{eq:4}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fb_1}
\frac{I_1}{U_{X6}} = H_{FB}(s) = \frac{Z_2-Z_3-Z_4}{(Z_1+Z_2)(Z_2-Z_3-Z_4)-Z_2^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fb_2}
    H_{FB}(s) = \frac{s^3 h + s^2 k + s l}{s^4 m + s^3 n + s^2 o + s p + q}
\end{equation}

Where

\begin{equation}
    h = 2(C_1 C_2 G_1 M) - (C_1 C_2 G_1 L_2)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    k = -(C_1 C_2 G_1 R_2) - (C_1 C_2)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    l = -C_1 G_1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    m = (C_1 C_2 G_1 L_1 L_2)-2(C_1 C_2 G_1 L_1 M)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fb_n}
    n = (C_1 C_2 G_1 L_1 R_2) + (C_1 C_2 L_1) + (C_1 C_2 G_1 R_1 L_2) - 2(C_1 C_2 G_1 R_1 M)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fb_o}
    o = (C_1 G_1 L_1) + (C_1 C_2 R_1) + (C_2 G_1 L_2) -2(C_2 G_1 M)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fb_p}
    p = (C_1 G_1 R_1) + (C_2 G_1 R_2) + C_2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fb_q}
    q = G_1
\end{equation}

\Cref{fig:fb_bode} Shows the bode plot for the transfer function $H_{FB}(s)$.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Bode plot of the transfer function for the feedback signals $H_{FB}(s)$}
    \label{fig:fb_bode}
\end{figure}

Here we see a much sharper peak at the resonant frequency than in the bode plot for the resonant circuit $H(s)$. We also see that the response is not less steep at frequencies higher than the resonance frequency. The resonant frequency $f_0$ is 160kHz and the magnitude is 0dB at resonance.


\Cref{fig:fb_step} shows the step and impulse response of the feedback transfer function $H_{FB}(s)$.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/FeedBackResponse.eps}
    \caption{Step and impulse response of transfer function for the feedback current}
    \label{fig:fb_step}
\end{figure}

Here we see a damped sinusoiodal response with a frequency $f_s$ of 167kHz witch is slightly higher than the resonant frequency $f_0$ of 160kHz. The step response of the feedback signal attenuates slower than the step response of the resonant circuit.

\Cref{fig:fbpolezero} shows the pole and zero plot for the transfer function for the feedback signals $H_{FB}(s)$.

\end{figure}

\Cref{tab:fbcoilrigpoles} shows the numerical values of the poles and zeros of the transfer function for the feedback signals $H_{FB}(s)$.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        Poles & Zeros \\
        $(-47 + 0i)\cdot 10^{5} s^{-1}$ & \\
        $(-0,5 + 10i)\cdot 10^{5} s^{-1}$ & $0$ \\
        $(-0,5 - 10i)\cdot 10^{5} s^{-1}$ & $-48\cdot 10^{5} s^{-1}$ \\
        $(-2,1 + 0i)\cdot 10^{5} s^{-1}$ & $-2,1\cdot 10^{5} s^{-1}$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Poles and zeros for $H_{FB}(s)$}
    \label{tab:fbcoilrigpoles}
\end{table}

Here we observe a complex conjugated pole pair in the left half plane, two real poles in the left half plane. As well as three zeros, two in the left half plane and one in origo. We see that the pole and zero close to origo cancel each other out, but the pole and zero further to the left does not completely cancel out. This system is dominated by the complex conjugated pole pair together with the zero in origo. The pole and zero far to the left will have little effect. This implies a band pass filter, the complex conjugated poles are close to the imaginary axis which gives a higher magnitude and is consistent with the desired functionality.

\Cref{fig:fblinsim} shows the result of a linear simulation of the transfer function of the feedback signal with a 160V peak square wave input signal with amplitude 1 and frequency 159kHz.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Linear simulation of transfer function with square wave with $f=f_0$ as input}
    \label{fig:fblinsim}
\end{figure}

Here we see a sinusoidal current that grows rapidly for 9 cycles to 182A then stabilizes at 186A. We also see that the input signal switches when the current is zero, though after some cycles the input signal drifts out of sync with the current.

\section{Magnitude analysis}
By taking the magnitudes for each variable listed in \cref{tab:mod_params} and inserting them into the different terms in the transfer function $H(s)$ (\cref{eq:4}) we can see witch terms influence the result and witch terms are insignificant. In \cref{tab:termsh} the values of each of the terms making up the main terms in \cref{eq:4}, are listed after inserting the magninudes in \cref{tab:mod_params}. e, f, and g are not listed since they only have a single term each.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        a & $(C_1 C_2 G_1 L_1 L_2)$   & $2 \cdot 10^{-29}$ \\
          & $2 (C_1 C_2 G_1 L_1 M)$   & $8 \cdot 10^{-32}$ \\
          & $(C_1 C_2 G_1 M^2)$       & $8 \cdot 10^{-31}$ \\
        \hline
        b & $(C_1 C_2 G_1 L_1 R_2)$   & $2 \cdot 10^{-26}$ \\

          & $2 (C_1 C_2 G_1 M R_1)$   & $8 \cdot 10^{-26}$ \\
          & $(C_1 C_2 L_1)$           & $1 \cdot 10^{-23}$ \\
        \hline
        c & $(C_1 C_2 G_1 R_1 R_2)$   & $2 \cdot 10^{-20}$ \\
          & $(C_1 C_2 R_1)$           & $1 \cdot 10^{-17}$ \\
          & $(C_1 G_1 L_1)$           & $2 \cdot 10^{-17}$ \\
          & $(C_2 G_1 L_2)$           & $2 \cdot 10^{-17}$ \\
          & $2 (C_2 G_1 M)$           & $8 \cdot 10^{-20}$ \\
        \hline
        d & $(C_1 G_1 R_1)$           & $2 \cdot 10^{-11}$ \\
          & $(C_2 G_1 R_2)$           & $2 \cdot 10^{-14}$ \\
          & $C_2$                     & $1 \cdot 10^{-11}$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Magnitudes of parameters in H(s)}
    \label{tab:termsh}
\end{table}

From \cref{tab:termsh} we see that the first term of $a$ is the largest, and the second and third terms are two and one orders smaller. Thus they are not significant and can be removed without reducing accuracy significantly. Further the first and third terms of $b$ are three orders smaller than the second and fourth terms and can be removed with the same reasoning. The second and fourth terms of $b$ are of the same magnitude and is thus equally significant. Two terms can be removed from $c$ and one term from $d$. e, f, and g only contains one term each and can not be simplified. This gives the simplified main parameters shown in \cref{eq:ab_simp} and \cref{eq:cd_simp}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ab_simp}
    a' = (C_1 C_2 G_1 L_1 L_2), b' = [(C_1 C_2 G_1 L_2 R_1)+(C_1 C_2 L_1)],
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cd_simp}
    c' = [(C_1 C_2 R_1)+(C_1 G_1 L_1)+(C_2 G_1 L_2)], d' = [(C_1 G_1 R_1) + C_2]
\end{equation}

Inserting the magnitudes from \cref{tab:mod_params} in $H(s)$ both before and after simplifying gives the same result when rounded to one significant digit as shown in \cref{tab:beforeafter}.

When the electric discharge from the top load of the resonant circuit forms long threads or filaments in the air this is called a streamer discharge \citep{streamer}. When a streamer discharge happens this affects the resonant circuit, this influence is proposed modeled as a varying conductance. A model for this conductance is found from an article \citep{575670} combining two classical models for electric discharge. This model is shown in \cref{eq:g1},

\begin{equation} \label{eq:g1}
    G_1 = G_{min} + [ 1 - \exp(-\frac{i_{G1}^2}{I_0^2})] \frac{U_{X7} i_{G1}}{E_0^2} + [\exp(-\frac{i_{G1}^2}{I_0^2})] \frac{i_{G1}^2}{P_0} - \theta \frac{d G_1}{dt}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
    \theta = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \exp(-\alpha |i|)
\end{equation}

and the parameters in this model are shown in \cref{tab:g1params}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
         & Comment &  &\\ \hline
        $G_{min}$ & Least possible conductance &  &\\
        $\theta$  & Streamer dampening factor &  &\\
        $I_o$     & Limit between large and small current &  &\\
        $E_0$     & Constant, steady state streamer voltage &  &\\
        $P_0$     & Constant power loss from streamer &  & \\
        $i_{G1}$  & Current flowing in streamer      &  & \\
        $U_{X7}$     & Voltage over streamer            &  &
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Parameters for model for $G_1$}
    \label{tab:g1params}
\end{table}

$G_{min}$ is the least possible conductance from the top load $C_2$ to ground. This conductance is present before any streamers form as well as after streamers have formed.

\subsection{Streamer capacitance}
It is also proposed, based on the general consensus in the hobby community \citep{streamercapacitance}, that the streamer increases the capacitance of the top load $C_2$.

\begin{equation}
    C_2' = C_2 + C_s = C_2 + l C_u
\end{equation}

Where $C_s$ is the capacitance introduced by the streamer. $l$ is the length of the streamer in meters, $C_u$ is the capacitance of the streamer per meter. This is an approximation, the actual capacitance of the streamer can be calculated from the definition of capacitance and becomes a complicated equation that also depends on the ratio between length and width of the streamer. Two values for the capacitance per meter used in the hobby community are 25pF \citep{conner}, and 5pF \citep{scantesla}.

\section{Varying parameters}

\Cref{fig:bode_r1} shows the bode plot of the transfer function for the resonant circuit $H(s)$ with 5 different values for $R_1$, $0\Omega$, $1\Omega$, $5\Omega$, $10\Omega$, and $100\Omega$. The other parameters are given in \cref{tab:mod_params} for this entire section.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Bode plot of $H(s)$ varying $R_1$}
    \label{fig:bode_r1}
\end{figure}

Here we see that a lower resistance $R_1$ gives a sharper peak, and higher magnitude on the output.

\newpage
\Cref{fig:fbbode_r1} shows the bode plot of the transfer function for the current in the primary resonant circuit $H_{FB}(s)$ with 5 different values for $R_1$, $0\Omega$, $1\Omega$, $5\Omega$, $10\Omega$, and $100\Omega$.

    \caption{Bode plot of $H_{FB}(s)$ varying $R_1$}
    \label{fig:fbbode_r1}
\end{figure}

Here we see the same trend as in \cref{fig:bode_r1}, a lower resistance $R_1$ gives a sharper peak, and higher magnitude on the output. From this we can conclude that $R_1$ should be as low as possible. This is consistent with design recommendations in the hobby community, and the known formula for Q value \cref{eq:Q} for a single series resonant circuit.

\Cref{fig:bode_r2} shows the bode plot of the transfer function for the resonant circuit $H(s)$ with 5 different values for $R_2$, $0\Omega$, $1k\Omega$, $10k\Omega$, $100k\Omega$, and $1M\Omega$.

    \caption{Bode plot of $H(s)$ varying $R_2$}
    \label{fig:bode_r2}
\end{figure}

Here we see that a lower resistance $R_2$ gives a higher magnitude on the output, but does not affect the sharpness of the peak.

\Cref{fig:fbbode_r2} shows the bode plot of the transfer function for the current in the primary resonant circuit $H_{FB}(s)$ with 5 different values for $R_2$, $0\Omega$, $1\Omega$, $10\Omega$, $100\Omega$, and $1k\Omega$.

\Cref{fig:bode_g1} shows the bode plot of the transfer function for the resonant circuit $H(s)$ with 5 different values for $G_1$, $1T{\Omega}^{-1}$, $1k{\Omega}^{-1}$, $1\mu{\Omega}^{-1}$, $1p{\Omega}^{-1}$, and $0{\Omega}^{-1}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/CoilRigBode_G1.eps}
    \caption{Bode plot of $H(s)$ varying $G_1$}
    \label{fig:bode_g1}
\end{figure}

Here we see that although we have a large range of values for $G_1$ the plots group in two, and there only seems to be a difference if $G_1$ is larger or smaller than 1. The top group of plots are a result of values larger than 1, and the lower group are a result of values smaller than 1. We cannot draw any significant conclusions from this.

\Cref{fig:fbbode_g1} shows the bode plot of the transfer function for the current in the primary resonant circuit $H_{FB}(s)$ with 5 different values for $G_1$, $1m{\Omega}^{-1}$, $100\mu{\Omega}^{-1}$, $10\mu{\Omega}^{-1}$, $1\mu{\Omega}^{-1}$, and $0{\Omega}^{-1}$.

    \caption{Bode plot of $H_{FB}(s)$ varying $G_1$}
    \label{fig:fbbode_g1}
\end{figure}

Here we see that when $G_1$ becomes larger than $~1\cdot10^{-5}{\Omega}^{-1}$ we get a dip where the resonance peak was. This indicates we are unable to get any feedback signal. Thus $G_1$ should be smaller than $~1\cdot10^{-5}{\Omega}^{-1}$, this is hard to control. This also implies that a streamer from the top load will affect the feedback signal, and with a too big streamer load the system with primary current feedback will be unable to function.

\Cref{fig:bode_k} shows the bode plot of the transfer function for the resonant circuit $H(s)$ with 5 different values for $k$, 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.001.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/CoilRigBode_k.eps}
    \caption{Bode plot of $H(s)$ varying $k$}
    \label{fig:bode_k}
\end{figure}

From this we see that the closer $k$ is to 1, the larger the magnitude, the sharpness and location of the peak does not seem to be affected.

\Cref{fig:fbbode_k} shows the bode plot of the transfer function for the current in the primary resonant circuit $H_{FB}(s)$ with 5 different values for $k$, 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.001.

    \caption{Bode plot of $H_{FB}(s)$ varying $k$}
    \label{fig:fbbode_k}
\end{figure}

Here we see no effect of varying $k$. From this it may seem that a $k$ of 1 is the best. But we know from the hobby community that a $k$ above to 0.2 causes significant risk of arcing between the primary and secondary coils \citep{scantesla} \citep{loneoceans} \citep{conner} \citep{easternvoltage} \citep{terrel} \citep{chunkyboy86}.

    \caption{Bode plot of $H(s)$ varying $C_1$}
    \label{fig:bode_c1}
\end{figure}

From this we see that the resonance peak changes according to the change in $C_1$ as expected from the formula for resonance in a single resonance circuit. The magnitude seems to be a function of the resonance frequency, and it seems a larger magnitude may be obtained by reducing the value of $C_1$. This does not match with the hobby community recommendation of the two resonance frequencies needing to be the same.
