\section{Audio}

The audio produced by a musical tesla coil is distinctive and subjectively easily distinguished from the sounds produces by other musical instruments. The reason for this is that different musical instruments produce different harmonics (or overtones) based on different parameters in the instrument. In musical terms this is called timbre.
