The Tesla Coil is a form of resonant transformer invented by Nikolai Tesla and used for experiments with artificial illumination \citep{5570149}. A resonant transformer consists of two inductively coupled coils, each loaded with a capacitance such that they get the same resonance frequencies. The resonant transformer has since gotten a lot of applications, among others; RFID, NFC, and Wireless charging. The resonant transformer in the form of the Tesla Coil has also become a popular entertainment device.
