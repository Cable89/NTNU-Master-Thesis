\chapter{Measurements}
To confirm that the signals $X1$-$X9$ have the alleged behaviour measurements have been done on a physically implemented DRSSTC, with the component values shown in the schematics in this thesis. The DRSSTC the measurements are done on is the one constructed by Omega Verksted \citep{prosjektoppgave} \citep{githubtesla}.


\section{Voltage measurements}
The voltage measurements of the tesla coil were performed in the high voltage laboratory at the department of electrical power engineering at NTNU.

\Cref{fig:m_x1-x2} shows the signal $X1$ into the pulse shaper and the resulting signal $X2$ on the output of the pulse shaper. The interrupter and power amplifier is not connected.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[trim={1cm 0cm 1cm 0cm},clip,width=\textwidth]{img/X1-X2.eps}
    \caption{$X1 $X2}
    \label{fig:m_x1-x2}
\end{figure}

Here we see that the sinusoidal signal $X1$ with zero DC component is transformed into a two level signal $X2$ between 0V and 5V. We also see that it has a constant duty cycle.

\Cref{fig:m_x1-x2-x4-x8} shows the same signals $X1$ and $X2$ as in \cref{fig:m_x1-x2} but also shows the output of the interrupter $X4$ as well as the feedback signal $X8$. Note that $X2$ is measured after the optical channel (\cref{sec:optical}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[trim={1cm 0cm 1cm 0cm},clip,width=\textwidth]{img/X1-X2-X4-X8.eps}
    \caption{$X1$ $X2$ $X4$ $X8$}
    \label{fig:m_x1-x2-x4-x8}
\end{figure}

First it is worth noting that we have more noise in \cref{fig:m_x1-x2-x4-x8} than in \cref{fig:m_x1-x2} because the interrupter, power amplifier, and resonant circuit are connected and turned on. We see that this electromagnetic noise affects how well $X2$ is generated, and the duty cycle is no longer constant. This is a source of noise on the output acoustic signal. The envelope of $X4$ follows $X2$ as expected. The envelope of $X8$ follows $X2$ as well as it having a ring down.

\Cref{fig:m_x6} shows the voltage on the output of the power amplifier $U_{X6}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[trim={3.2cm 0cm 3.2cm 0cm},clip,width=\textwidth]{img/X6singlepulse.eps}
    \caption{$X6$}
    \label{fig:m_x6}
\end{figure}

Here we see a positive square wave with 50\% duty cycle and amplitude from 0V to 160V, and a duration of 13 cycles before being turned off. After this wave train we see the ring down of the voltage on the resonant circuit.

\section{Acoustic measurements}

The acoustic measurements of the tesla coil were performed in the high voltage laboratory at the department of electrical power engineering at NTNU. This was the only location fitting after health and safety considerations were made. This room is not designed for acoustic measurements, and has significant ambient noise and reflections.

The coil rig were placed in the room with a grounding electrode consisting an orb and spike with identical design as the topload placed a distance of ~40cm away. The driver was placed 3 meters away connected with a 3m long cable. The signal generator, pulse shaper, and recording equipment was placed adjacent to the driver.

The recording was performed by the department of acoustics at ntnu.

Since the room was not meant for acoustic measurements the impulse response of the room was measured. This measurement was also performed by the department of acoustics at ntnu. This was done by placing a speaker approximately in the center of the room, and a microphone were the microphone was to be placed during recordings. Then a sweep was played on the speaker, and recorded.

The recordings of single tones was performed by setting the signal generator to the wanted input frequency and then the output sound was recorded.

The recordings of musical audio files was performed by playing the file from a computer and then recording the output sound.

The sweep was recorded by playing a sweep from a different computer, and then recording, When playing the sweep we discovered that the computer playing back the sweep (and recording) was affected by the electromagnetic field generated by the tesla coil, and the playback was thus choppy. It was later discovered that all recordings done were choppy.

The acoustic measurements done but not discussed here is attached in \cref{sec:appdx:akustisk}

\Cref{fig:period_1k} shows a periodogram of the recorded audio signal with a 1kHz input on $X2$. The amplitude is the energy of the signal and the x-axis shows the frequency.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Periodogram of 1kHz recorded tone}
    \label{fig:period_1k}
\end{figure}

Here we see the base frequency 1kHz and harmonics spaced 1kHz apart all the way through the range of human hearing. We see that the lowest three harmonics together with the base frequency are dominant, then the energy of the harmonics start to decrease. This implies the waveform rises sharply and has a short duration, which is consistent with a series of electrical discharges. The amplitudes of the harmonics are shown in \cref{tab:1k_amps}.

\Cref{fig:recorded_1k} shows the waveform of the recorded audio signal with a 1kHz input on $X2$.

    \caption{Time domain plot of 1kHz recorded tone}
    \label{fig:recorded_1k}
\end{figure}

Here we see a dominant series of pulses with frequency 1kHz, we also see that it has several higher harmonics. Which is consistent with \cref{fig:period_1k}. The signal also appears to be noisy.

From this figure we see that the reconstructed signal matches well with the exception of the reconstructed signal not having any frequency components other than the harmonics.
